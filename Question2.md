### How to deal with Viruses Or In-Effective Anti Virus.

If everything else in your computer is in order, then you should consider the presence of a virus or an in-effective antivirus that fails to detect and prevent viruses from attacking your computer as the reason behind your computer running slow.

Viruses can present themselves in various forms, from random pop-ups to the unauthorized encryption of files. There are also viruses that run in the background stealthily that could be eating up into your resources.

Download a verified and recognized antivirus program as your cybersecurity tool. Use it to run a malware scan on your computer for viruses or malware frequently.
